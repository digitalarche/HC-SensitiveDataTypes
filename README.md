# HC-SensitiveDataTypes
Microsoft 365 Sensitive Information Types created for the Dutch HealthCare sector. These Sensitive Information Types can be used in for example: Office 365 DLP, Microsoft Cloud App Security and AIP Scanner

The following Sensitive Information Types are included:
*	Custom - Netherlands Citizen's Service (BSN) Number
*	Custom - Dutch Passport number
*	Custom - Netherlands ZIP Code + City
* Custom - Email addresses
*	Custom - general Sensitive Keywords
*	Custom - healthcare cure set 1
*	Custom - healthcare cure set 2
*	Custom - healthcare care set 1 - Zorgplan
*	Custom - healthcare care set 2 - DVO
*	Custom - healthcare care set 3 - WMO

## Why these Sensitive Information Types
Microsoft 365 includes 100 sensitive Information Types up to now. While this a great numnber, it does not include localized Sensitive Information Types for the Dutch martket, besides BSN. This set is build to extend on the build-in types and allow you to faster implement services like DLP without the need of building sensitive information types from scratch yourself.
